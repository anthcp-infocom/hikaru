Release Notes

v0.2a1
------
Adding in OpenShift Routes
Added PyYaml to fix get_yaml issue on Mac OSX

v0.2a0
------

- Added support a new two new styles of generated code from `get_python_source()`: the 'black' style, using the 'black' formatter, and None, which outputs syntactically correct Python but with no formatting at all (this is the fastest generation option and is good if the code is going to be dynamically executed).
- New `get_type_warnings()` method on HikaruBase objects; compares actual values with the types currently populating an instance, and looks for required values that are missing. Generates a list of warning records for any problems found.
- New `diff()` method of HikaruBase; compares to object hierarchies and generates difference records indicating where they are different.
- Removed dead code.
- Improved and documented all exceptions that are raised.
- Added support for round-tripping between YAML, Python objects, Python source, JSON, and Python dicts. You can now start with any of these, move between them, and get back the original representation.
- Raised testing coverage to 99% overall.
- Documentation updates; includes a section on patterns and recipes.

v0.1.1a0
--------

Bug fix; when creating Python source, when literal dicts were being written out,
non-string values were quoted as if they were strings. Now all dict values appropriately
include quotes.
